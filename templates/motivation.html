<div id="motivation">
    <p>After having studied History and American Studies at university I discovered that my true passion lay in software
    development. History is a fascinating hobby but not something I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. Creating
    something in the vast and exciting world of technology, however, I can do all day long.</p>

    <p>I got the opportunity to intern at a small firm that took the time to tutor me in Python and the basics of web
    development. With the skills I learnt there I applied for, and immediately got, a job as web developer at Getlogic.
    After having worked there for almost three years I decided I needed a new challenge and applied for a job as a
    Software Engineer at Paylogic.</p>

    <p>Software development for me is the creation of something from nothing. I receive satisfaction from both creating
    something from scratch as well as refactoring and improving existing code. Whether I refactor or write new code my
    main goal is to make it clean and easily understandable to others. Code that is easily understood is much less likely
    to be broken by another engineer when he inevitably has to work on your code.</p>

    <p>I am a proponent of a proper development process that is followed by all engineers within a team. A well thought
    out process, including a testing strategy, can prevent many of the common issues within a team
    (recurring bugs, delays and an understanding of what to build). Proper tools are also an important part of the
    development process, every engineer has his own set of tools he has gathered over the years and has tweaked to his
    own style of working, but it is of equal importance that the team as a whole has the proper tools as well
    (Continuous Integration, test suites, version control, etc.).</p>
