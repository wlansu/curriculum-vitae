            <p>As a software engineer at Zupr my role is very free flowing. Together with my team members and
				Project Manager I decide what goals to strive for every sprint. Maintenance is one
				third of the sprint, refining and improving the product is what creates a maintainable, future proof, project.</p>

			<p>Lately I've been focusing on importing large product feeds into our PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch
				databases. This has been quite the trip into Big Data territory, running the imports through Celery to make it scalable
				and dabbling in asyncio.</p>

            <p>Paylogic is an online ticketing service which uses a highly available queue to handle tens of thousands

            <p>I took the lead in upgrading the Django framework on top of which the Paylogic codebase is built.
            Leapfrogging several versions. This entailed major refactoring of our codebase and rewriting large parts
            of it.</p>

            <p>To showcase the Paylogic API I implemented the <a target="_blank" href="http://ml.paylogic.com">Millenniumland</a> demo
            website, a stand alone mock dance event website demonstrating the ease of use of the API and the modern design
            techniques Paylogic is capable of.</p>

            <p>I helped build an inventory management system coupled to a user friendly backend for a bookshop.
            This system used portable scanners to keep track of the current inventory.</p>

            <p>During my time at Getlogic the Dutch government complied with European legislation pertaining to
            Cookies. As we would have to build in so called “cookie bars” in most of our websites I took it upon
            myself to build a small library to make this as easy as possible, and made it open source.
